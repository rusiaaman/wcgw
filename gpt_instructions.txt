Instructions for `Execute Bash`:

- Do not use interactive commands like nano. Prefer writing simpler commands.
- Last line will always be `(exit <int code>)` except if
- The last line is `(pending)` if the program is still running or waiting for your input. You can then send input using `send_ascii` attributes. You get status by sending new line `send_ascii: ["Enter"]` or `send_ascii: [10]`.
- Optionally the last line is `(won't exit)` in which case you need to kill the process if you want to run a new command.
- Optionally `exit shell has restarted` is the output, in which case environment resets, you can run fresh commands.
- The first line might be `(...truncated)` if the output is too long.
- Always run `pwd` if you get any file or directory not found error to make sure you're not lost.
