## Updates

- [9 Dec 2024] [Vscode extension to paste context on Claude app](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmanRusia.wcgw)  

- [01 Dec 2024] Removed author hosted relay server for chatgpt.

- [26 Nov 2024] Introduced claude desktop support through mcp

## üöÄ Highlights

- ‚ö° **Full Shell Access**: No restrictions, complete control.
- ‚ö° **Desktop control on Claude**: Screen capture, mouse control, keyboard control on claude desktop (on mac with docker linux)
- ‚ö° **Create, Execute, Iterate**: Ask claude to keep running compiler checks till all errors are fixed, or ask it to keep checking for the status of a long running command till it's done.
- ‚ö° **Large file edit**: Supports large file incremental edits to avoid token limit issues. Faster than full file write.
- ‚ö° **Interactive Command Handling**: Supports interactive commands using arrow keys, interrupt, and ansi escape sequences.
- ‚ö° **REPL support**: [beta] Supports python/node and other REPL execution.

## Top use cases examples

- Solve problem X using python, create and run test cases and fix any issues. Do it in a temporary directory
- Find instances of code with X behavior in my repository
- Git clone https://github.com/my/repo in my home directory, then understand the project, set up the environment and build
- Create a golang htmx tailwind webapp, then open browser to see if it works (use with puppeteer mcp)
- Edit or update a large file
- In a separate branch create feature Y, then use github cli to create a PR to original branch
- Command X is failing in Y directory, please run and fix issues
- Using X virtual environment run Y command
- Using cli tools, create build and test an android app. Finally run it using emulator for me to use
- Fix all mypy issues in my repo at X path.
- Using 'screen' run my server in background instead, then run another api server in bg, finally run the frontend build. Keep checking logs for any issues in all three
- Create repo wide unittest cases. Keep iterating through files and creating cases. Also keep running the tests after each update. Do not modify original code.

## Claude Setup

First install `uv` https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods

Then update `claude_desktop_config.json` (~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wcgw": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "tool",
        "run",
        "--from",
        "wcgw@latest",
        "--python",
        "3.12",
        "wcgw_mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart claude app.

_If there's an error in setting up_

- Make sure `uv` in the system PATH by running `uv --version` and also ensure `uv tool run wcgw --version` works globally.
  Otherwise, re-install uv and follow instructions to add it into your .zshrc or .bashrc
- If there's still an issue, check that `uv tool run --from wcgw@latest --python 3.12 wcgw_mcp` runs in your terminal. It should have no output and shouldn't exit.
- Debug the mcp server using `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@0.1.7 uv tool run --from wcgw@latest --python 3.12 wcgw_mcp`

### Installing via Smithery

To install wcgw for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/wcgw):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install wcgw --client claude
```

### [Optional] Computer use support using desktop on docker

Computer use is disabled by default. Add `--computer-use` to enable it. This will add necessary tools to Claude including ScreenShot, Mouse and Keyboard control.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wcgw": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "tool",
        "run",
        "--from",
        "wcgw@latest",
        "--python",
        "3.12",
        "wcgw_mcp",
        "--computer-use"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Claude will be able to connect to any docker container with linux environment. Native system control isn't supported outside docker.

You'll need to run a docker image with desktop and optional VNC connection. Here's a demo image:

```sh
docker run -p 6080:6080 ghcr.io/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts:computer-use-demo-latest
```

Then ask claude desktop app to control the docker os. It'll connect to the docker container and control it.

Connect to `http://localhost:6080/vnc.html` for desktop view (VNC) of the system running in the docker.

The following requirements should be installed and working in the linux docker image:

1. Needs `xdotool` to execute commands on the desktop.
2. Needs `scrot` to take screenshots.
3. Needs `convert` from imagemagick to convert images.

### Usage

Wait for a few seconds. You should be able to see this icon if everything goes right.

over here

![mcp icon](https://github.com/rusiaaman/wcgw/blob/main/static/claude-ss.jpg?raw=true)

Then ask claude to execute shell commands, read files, edit files, run your code, etc.

If you've run the docker for LLM to access, you can ask it to control the "docker os". If you don't provide the docker container id to it, it'll try to search for available docker using `docker ps` command.


### [Optional] Vs code extension 
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmanRusia.wcgw

Commands: 
- Select a text and press `cmd+'` and then enter instructions. This will switch the app to Claude and paste a text containing your instructions, file path, workspace dir, and the selected text.

## [Optional] Local shell access with openai API key or anthropic API key

### Openai

Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_ORG_ID` env variables.

Then run

`uvx --from wcgw@latest wcgw_local  --limit 0.1` # Cost limit $0.1

You can now directly write messages or press enter key to open vim for multiline message and text pasting.

### Anthropic

Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env variable.

Then run

`uvx --from wcgw@latest wcgw_local --claude`

You can now directly write messages or press enter key to open vim for multiline message and text pasting.
