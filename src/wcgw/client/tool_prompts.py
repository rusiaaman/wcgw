- Always call this at the start of the conversation before using any of the shell tools from wcgw.
- Use `any_workspace_path` to initialize the shell in the appropriate project directory.
- If the user has mentioned a workspace or project root or any other file or folder use it to set `any_workspace_path`.
- If user has mentioned any files use `initial_files_to_read` to read, use absolute paths only (~ allowed)
- By default use mode "wcgw"
- In "code-writer" mode, set the commands and globs which user asked to set, otherwise use 'all'.
- Use type="first_call" if it's the first call to this tool.
- Use type="user_asked_mode_change" if in a conversation user has asked to change mode.
- Use type="reset_shell" if in a conversation shell is not working after multiple tries.
- Use type="user_asked_change_workspace" if in a conversation user asked to change workspace

- Execute a bash command. This is stateful (beware with subsequent calls).
- Status of the command and the current working directory will always be returned at the end.
- The first or the last line might be `(...truncated)` if the output is too long.
- Always run `pwd` if you get any file or directory not found error to make sure you're not lost.
- Do not run bg commands using "&", instead use this tool.
- Do not use 'cat' to read files, use ReadFiles tool instead
- In order to check status of previous command, use `status_check` with empty command argument.
- Only command is allowed to run at a time. You need to wait for any previous command to finish before running a new one.
- Programs don't hang easily, so most likely explanation for no output is usually that the program is still running, and you need to check status again.
- Do not send Ctrl-c before checking for status till 10 minutes or whatever is appropriate for the program to finish.
- Only run long running commands in background. Each background command is run in a new non-reusable shell.
- On running a bg command you'll get a bg command id that you should use to get status or interact.

- percentage_to_change should be low if mostly new code is to be added. It should be high if a lot of things are to be replaced.
- If percentage_to_change > 50, provide full file content in text_or_search_replace_blocks
- If percentage_to_change <= 50, text_or_search_replace_blocks should be search/replace blocks.
