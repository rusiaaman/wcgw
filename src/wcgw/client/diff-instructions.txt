def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")

def call_hello():
    "call hello"

    hello()
    print("Called")
    impl1()
    hello()
    impl2()

# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
Every "<<<<<<< SEARCH" section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, whitespaces, etc.

Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough and only enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines (0-3 lines) if needed for uniqueness.
Other than for uniqueness, avoid including those lines which do not change in search (and replace) blocks. Target 0-3 non trivial extra lines per block.

Preserve leading spaces and indentations in both SEARCH and REPLACE blocks.
